# Is there a closed source moat?

Here is the basic view I am going to be defending: Closed source has
little to no moat in general. The time till things are open source is
rapidly shrinking and hardware is constraints are a shrinking barrier. The
only place for companies making AI to go is to vertically integrate
these products with the rest of their suite providing an indirect
way to continue their ad businesses which are threatened by this very
technology. Infrastructure as a service will become the main way they
make money. Even then the field is ripe for decentralisation.

In short, proprietary profit software is being assailed from all angles where
it was once secure. The same reasons that support this conclusion for
Artificial Intelligence also support this for other software (perhaps
also with hardware but this is a harder case for me to make as this
outside a modicum of my specialties).

As it becomes easier to create open source alternatives it becomes harder
to justify creating closed source ones. It is worth considering that we
don't really talk about closed source alternatives very much if there
are open source ones since it is very difficult to sell something if you
are competeing with total freedom (usually this is both free as in beer
and free as in libre).[Insert wikipedia link to free software]

I have identified three major moats and three minor moats that had once
existed between open source and closed source and demonstrate how and
why they are declining and how some are even becoming the reverse--that
is--reasons to go open source. Each of these moats fits into a wider
category of being either Artificial or Natural. I will discuss the nature
of open source and proprietary software, the way that nature corresponds
to certian incentives; the moats and ladders that each has, the data and
evidence that underlies both of these, and the work that I have done in
open source to break and/or push barriers and build ladders so that you
can get a more real world case study for what works and does not when
working in open source.

The six moats I will discuss are: Hardware constriants (in the past you
could really only build and test certian software on really expensive
hardware and getting access was extremely difficult not so with the advent
of cloud computing), Community collaboration (public repository sites like
github and tools like git make collaboration betweeen decentralized actors
much simpler), Funding (crowd funding and marketability of open source
with Software-as-a-service has greatly improved allowing open source
solutions to more easily gain cashflow). These are the major barriers,
the minor ones are: Legal licencing, (LLMs will make getting legal
opinions and knowledge much cheaper to navigate for open source actors
even if laws are put in place to dissaude this activity) Skilled labour
(the time until a developer can offer a productive advantage seems to
be decreasing it is much easier for new developers to get up to speed
compared to before thanks to digital communities),

## Time and dedication

I could have given this section a simpler title. I think that effort
would have fit quite well. But titles matter less than the substance
and the people that care to read through this drivel are the ones I am
writing this for and not those who want the AI created SparkNotes.

The first moat is the time and dedication or the effort that an endeavour
takes. This is the most easily understood natural barrier to a technology
both being open source and closed source. Something's, really happen on
such long time spans that no one cares to sell it for a profit such that
only people with

It is simpler to think of the process to make something without
having to think about how to get funding and have that thing make
money. Product design is fucking hard man. Closed source exists to
protect the creator from the pressures of the market and from people
that would copy them allowing the monopolization of the goods of that
creation. In that protection they create a moat. 

### Artificial and Natural Barriers

But it is what one can say is an artificial barrier. A barrier created by
the state in this case but it isn't a natural barrier in that it is not
a moat that is innate to the development of the technology itself. As we
investigate moats or barriers I will continue to bring up whether they
are natural or artificial. Natural barriers are assialable only with new
technology while artificial barriers require people to simply legislate
something else. As to how rigorous there really is a demarcation between
these two is something that could be ignore and my point would still
have equal weight thinking about moats in this way is just an easier
way I tend to catorgize them and the similar barriers they have to being
overcome or created.

[Insert an example of natural versus artificial barriers]

To illustrate this, let's say we have two people: Sandra and Hermes. They
each come to github with the same project and need a way for people to
gain interest in their idea and a way to fund it so that they either
feel motivated to continue or that is held robust from certain negative
constraints. For example, one of them gains a sever medical injury and
is unable to work for a long time without superior medical care that
the funding would have provided them or they are able to hire people
offload the work to.

This has a profound affect on how fast and for how long open source
versus closed source solutions can reach parity. And there are very hard
barriers for open source to overcome in order it to either be a first
mover or begin to outcompete closed source. However, these barrier are
[shrinking](https://staltz.com/time-till-open-source-alternative.html)
faster and faster overtime as open source developers and the community
at large gets better and better at increasing the stability of open
source solutions.


Notes: I need more examples and data to make my point I think a reorganisation would also help make what I am writing more easily readable.
